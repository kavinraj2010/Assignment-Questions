        Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.
        
        
QSTN  : What are the advantages in inheritance?

ANS   : * Code Reusability
        * Easy to maintanance
        * Effective memory management
        
        
QSTN  : example for selenium ?

ANS   : Selenium is a open source tool for automation testing.
        ex:   Child Class           Parent Class
                   |                    |
            * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
            * ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
            * RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
            * WebDriver extends SearchContext
            * Interface SearchContext
            
            
QSTN  : What is methodOverloading with example?

ANS   : In a class Methods have same name with differ in parameters is called method overloading. And method overloading is a compile time polymorphism.
        ex:   System.out.println(x);  =>here we declare multiple datatype for the variable x so it is realtime example for method overloading.
        
        
QSTN  : What is methodOverriding with example?

ANS   : In a package more number of classes with same method name is override from the parent class is known as Method Overriding.
        And this is called as Runtime polymorphism.
        ex:   SetFileDetector();  =>This is used to set the file path for manually download the driver.
