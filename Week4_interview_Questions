QSTN  :   1.What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.

ANS   :   Selenium is a open source automated testing framework, which is used to validate web applications from different browsers and platforms.
          The four types of selenium components are:
              ->  Selenium IDE - (Integrated Development Environment)
              ->  Selenium RC - (Remote Control)
              ->  Selenium WebDriver
              ->  Selenium  Grid
              
           Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that works with open source web APIs. It operates by the commands,
           By sending those commands to the browser and interacting with the application.
           
           
QSTN  :   2.How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?

ANS   :   ->To communicate between browser and clients, Selenium WebDriver uses JSON. 
          ->JSON wire protocol is a REST (Representational State Transfer) API that transfers the information between the http servers.
          ->Each browser has its own HTTP server.
          
          
QSTN  :   3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
          
ANS   :   There are 8 locators to find an element in a selenium are:
              ->  Id
              ->  Name
              ->  ClassName
              ->  LinkText
              ->  PartialLinkTest
              ->  TagName
              ->  Xpath
              ->  CssSelector
              
              
QSTN  :   4.Why ID is preferable than X-Path?

ANS   :   X-path is a relative path finding it has some time 2 more elements in a same path.
          So that we can prefer ID, Id is a unique key for element. There is one Id is not same with other element.
          
QSTN  :   5.How to select value in dropdown?

ANS   :   ->  Create a select class in a selenium and import the select class.
          ->  Find the element want to select and then select the options by
              *selectByvalue();
              *selectByIndex();
              *selectByVisibleText();
              
QSTN  :   6.What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?

ANS   :   An Absolute path contains full path of the element from the file directory top and down to the file.
          An Relative path contains path of the element from the directory of the relative element path.
          
QSTN  :   7.How to verify if the given check box is checked or not?

ANS   :   Using isSelected() to verify the return value is true means the check box is selected otherwise it return false the checkbox is not slected.

QSTN  :   8.Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager?

ANS   :   System.setproperty :  This is used to download the browser and set the path where the browser exists and property value in it.
          WebDriverManager  :   Thi is simply add the dependencies in pom.xml file in your project it can download and set the path automatically by using this method.


QSTN  :   9.Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths?

ANS   :   Following Xpath syntax:
            //tagName[x-path]/following::tagName[x-path]
            
          Preceding Xpath syntax:
            //tagName[x-path]/preceding::tagName[x-path]
            
            
QSTN  :   10.How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?

ANS   :   By using getAttribute() to get the value of the attribute of webelement.
          It returns string value, or it has boolen type return true or false, or it does not have any value return null.
